        <h3>Weight Loss</h3>
        <p>It's widely accepted that cycling is a low-impact way to stay in shape and shed unwanted pounds, but what do these numbers really look like? According to the Outdoor Foundation, the average person will lose around 13 pounds in the first year of commuting by bike to work, without making any other changes to their diet or workout routine.</p>

        <h3>Around the World</h3>
        <p>Fred A. Birchmore, 25, circled the globe by bicycle in 1935. The entire trip, through Europe, Asia, and the United States, covered forty thousand miles. He pedaled about 25,000 miles. The rest was traveled by boat. He wore out seven sets of tires.</p>

        <h3>Eat</h3>        
        <p>Lasting 21 days and over 3,000 kilometers, the Tour de France is one of the most grueling athletic events in the world. But while the mileage alone is impressive, so too is the diet of these professional cyclists. Each rider consumes between 5,000 to 7,000 calories every day, depending on the length and demands of the stage. Now that's a lot of pasta! </p>
